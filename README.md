# First Things First

Create React App (https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) is an amazing tool with sensible defaults.

That said, I for one would line to be able to tweak the webpack config without needing to 'eject' in turn losing all the benefits of the project (future updates etc...).

Case in point -> I want to use **Create React App** with **Preact**  (https://preactjs.com)

# How does this work?

The 'rewired' [react-scripts] have been setup to call an override function (config-overrides.js) which sits in your project directory.

That function receives 2 params (config, env)

* config is the webpack config from create-react-app
* env is the Node enviroment your running


Once you have a copy of the config you can modify it to add plugins etc...

```
module.exports = function override (config, env) {
  //setup preact
  config.resolve = {
    "alias": {
      "react": "preact-compat",
      "react-dom": "preact-compat"
    }
  }


  return config
}
```

# How can I use this?

For new projects assuming create-react-app is installed run

`create-react-app your-app-name --scripts-version rewire-react-scripts`

# Can I use this with an existing project?

Yes, swap out react-scripts with rewire-react-scripts in your package.json

This section

```
"devDependencies": {
    "react-scripts": "0.7.0"
  },
```

You'll also need to create a config-overrides.js file in your projects root directory (see sample with this repo).

Note:  I'll see about writing a script to handle this ðŸ˜ƒ .


# Here's a few ideas to start with
